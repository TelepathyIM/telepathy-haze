.SH NAME
telepathy-haze \- Telepathy connection manager using libpurple
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@libexecdir@/telepathy\-haze\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Haze implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification using libpurple,
allowing Telepathy clients like
.BR empathy (1)
to connect to any protocol supported by
.BR pidgin (1).
.PP
It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be
started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBHAZE_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options
(which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
.TP
\fBHAZE_PERSIST\fR=1
If set, Haze will not automatically close itself after five seconds without
any connections.
.TP
\fBHAZE_LOGFILE\fR=\fIfilename\fR
If set, all debugging output will be written to \fIfilename\fR rather than
to the terminal.
