telepathy-haze 0.8.1 (2020-11-11)
=================================

Dependencies:
• libpurple ≥ 2.10.12 is now required

Enhancements:

• Port tests to Python 3 (Arusekk)

Fixes:

• Fix the build with libpurple 2.10.12 (Koop Mast from FreeBSD.org)

• Fix a crash if a requested contact is already in contact-list
  (fd.0 #47005 Debarshi Ray)

telepathy-haze 0.8.0 (2013-10-02)
=================================

The “batch processing” release. This is a new stable branch,
recommended GNOME 3.10-based distributions.

Fixes:

• Report contacts with unknown presence as 'unknown' rather than raising
  an error, and don't crash if libpurple reports a "primitive status"
  that we don't understand (fd.o #69474, Simon)

• Fix a memory leak when IM channels are closed (fd.o #31723, Simon)

• Fix ContactGroups.SetContactGroups() implementation so it removes
  the contact from groups if desired (fd.o #49389, Simon)

telepathy-haze 0.7.1 (2013-09-17)
=================================

The “buzzes like a fridge” release.

This is a release candidate for telepathy-haze 0.8, recommended for
use with GNOME 3.10.

Deprecations:

• This will be the last branch with StreamedMedia support. Anyone
  relying on Haze for audio/video calling is invited to port it to Call1.

Enhancements:

• Support interactive password prompting for protocols like SIPE that
  have an optional password (fd.o #63326; Stefan Becker, Will Thompson)

Fixes:

• Adapt to Sametime accounts getting a "usersplit" in libpurple 2.10.1
  (fd.o #44631, Simon McVittie)

• Regression test improvements (fd.o #69269, #65290, #65296, #63119;
  Will Thompson, Guillaume Desmottes, Simon McVittie)

telepathy-haze 0.7.0 (2012-11-21)
=================================

This is the start of a new unstable branch. Don't swing on it too hard.

Enhancements:

• Jonny implemented ContactCapabilities;
• Simon got rid of some deprecated API;
• So did Xavier;
• Gabriele Giacone kindly mapped two of the extant Skype prpls to
  "skype-x11" and "skype-dbus". Maybe you'd like to give them a whirl?
  (fd.o#57201)


telepathy-haze 0.6.0 (2012-04-04)
=================================

This is the start of a new stable branch.

Changes since 0.5.0:

• The ContactBlocking interface has been implemented. (Jasper
  St. Pierre, Will)

Summary of particularly noteworthy changes since 0.4.x:

• telepathy-glib ≥ 0.13.9 and libpurple ≥ 2.7.0 are now required.

• The ContactList interface has been implemented.

• Support for setting your own alias has been added.

• The ServerAuthentication channel type has been implemented so users
  can provide an account password when connecting.

telepathy-haze 0.5.0 (2011-07-09)
=================================

The “paving stones” release. Please enjoy the fruits of 11 months'
sporadic development.

Dependencies:

• telepathy-glib ≥ 0.13.9 is now required.

• libpurple ≥ 2.7.0 is now required.

Enhancements:

 • fd.o #19902: use TpBaseContactList to implement Conn.I.ContactList,
   Conn.I.ContactGroups, and the stored list (smcv)

 • fd.o #37933: implement contact blocking (Jasper St. Pierre, wjt)

 • fd.o #13124: support setting your own alias (Felipe Contreras)

 • The Telepathy API to allow the user not to save their password is now
   implemented. (Jonny)

Fixes:

 • haze no longer ships with a manager file. (jonny)

 • Map PURPLE_CONNECTION_ERROR_OTHER_ERROR to AuthenticationFailed,
   since it's used for errors like being temporarily banned from the
   ICQ server, which should result in Mission Control not trying to
   reconnect (wjt)

 • fd.o #31846: translate the Jabber connection_security parameter in
   newer libpurple versions into two booleans, old-ssl and
   require-encryption (smcv)

 • fd.o #26155: make telepathy-glib criticals fatal by default (smcv)

 • fd.o #30594: don't claim that ICQ (and other) contacts support audio
   calls when they aren't even supported at all by libpurple on the
   protocol (Guillaume)

telepathy-haze 0.4.0 (2010-08-05)
=================================

The "JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!" release.

Dependencies:

 • libpurple ≥ 2.6 is now required

Fixes:

 • fd.o #23702: use uint16 for port numbers, and be permissive about
   minor type variations in what we're actually given (wjt)

telepathy-haze 0.3.6 (2010-07-09)
=================================

The “for once in your life you make a clean breakaway” release.

Fixes:

 • Removing a group no longer removes all the contacts in that group
   from your contact list; instead, they're placed in a default group.
   (fd.o#21294, smcv).

telepathy-haze 0.3.5 (2010-06-21)
=================================

The “four-dimensional giant slugs fighting in a hypercube” release.

Dependencies:

 • telepathy-glib >= 0.9.2 is now required;
 • glib >= 2.22 is now required.

Enhancements:

 • The Capabilities interface is now supported even when media is
   disabled, so contacts get text caps. (jonny)

 • The properties on the Avatars interface, added all the way back in
   spec 0.17.22, are now implemented. (smcv)

 • The “sipe” username is now correctly exposed as two parameters,
   “account” and “login”, rather than the user being required to combine
   the two with a comma in one field. (fd.o#28469, Stefan Becker)

Fixes:

 • The default character set is no longer forced to UTF-8; libpurple's
   default is respected. This works out better on ICQ, where most people
   who haven't thought about it use ISO-8859-1. (fd.o#23542, wjt)

telepathy-haze 0.3.4 (2010-03-05)
=================================

The “The People's Great and Harmonious Moon Hand” release.

Fixes:

 * Use the well-known Telepathy names for hidden and xa statuses to
   fix interoperability with Empathy, in particular the ability to be
   invisible on Haze accounts. (smcv)

 * Report the "loubserp-mxit" prpl as "mxit". (smcv)

 * Rename prpl-simple to the standard Telepathy protocol name
   'sip'. (smcv)

 * Be sure to link to glib and gobject, and fix typo when linking to
   dbus-glib, to ensure. Fixes fd.o#25124. (jonny)

Enhancements:

 * Implement the new draft mail notification spec. (stormer)

 * Implement streamed media. Fixes fd.o#24385. (Maiku)

telepathy-haze 0.3.3 (2010-01-25)
=================================

The “doing the fishstick in a standing ovation” release.

Dependencies:

 * telepathy-glib >= 0.7.36 is now required.

Fixes:

 * The secret connection parameters are now exposed as being secret in
   the manager file and also when the CM is introspected. This fixes
   fd.o#24067. (smcv)

 * Fix bug report URL for current bugzilla layout. (smcv)

 * Fix circular channel creation. (felipec)

Enhancements:

 * Start outputting debug messages on the Telepathy Debug interface by
   using telepathy-glib's TpDebugSender. (jonny, Maiku)

 * Stop using shave and allow use of automake 1.11's silent rules
   feature. (jonny)

telepathy-haze 0.3.2 (2009-08-25)
=================================

The “Isaac” release.

Fixes:

 * Yahoo! Japan-specific parameters are no longer listed for the 'yahoo'
   protocol in haze.manager. This fixes Gnome bug #591381. If you're
   using libpurple 2.6.0 or later, 'yahoojp' will be available as a
   separate protocol.

 * The "busy" status is exposed as Busy rather than as Away. This fixes
   fd.o#23441.

 * Haze now fails gracefully rather than asserting if you try to connect
   to MSN and your libpurple was built without SSL support. Fixes
   fd.o#22800.

Enhancements:

 * The Facebook protocol plugin is now special-cased to have a
   sensible name in the Telepathy API. It seems to work with Empathy
   2.27.91 if you delete haze.manager (which will no longer be shipped
   in a future release when stable releases of clients support it being
   absent).

telepathy-haze 0.3.1 (2009-06-05)
=================================

The “man3 encounters player, who quotes Hayek” release.

Enhancements:

 * Shaved `make` output, courtesy of Jonny Lamb. This is disabled by
   default; ./configure --enable-shave to enable it.

 * haze.manager has been updated for more recent libpurples. Fixes
   fd.o#17709.

Fixes:

 * Connection.GetInterfaces() now includes Requests. Fixes fd.o#21800.

telepathy-haze 0.3.0 (2009-04-04)
=================================

The “Google Abandonware” release.

Dependencies:

 * telepathy-glib >= 0.7.21 is now required.

Enhancements:

 * Connections implement the Requests, SimplePresence and Contacts
   interfaces, courtesy of Simon McVittie.
 * Text channels implement the Messages and Destroyable interfaces.
 * Courtesy of Simon McVittie, telepathy-gabble and FinnAir flight 0837,
   Haze now has a test suite! They test Haze connecting to a fake XMPP
   server; while not perfect (no-one should use Haze for XMPP in real
   life!) it's an improvement on no tests.

Fixes:

 * Text channels closed with pending messages now respawn. (Fixes
   fd.o#17842.)
 * Compiles without warnings on AMD64, courtesy of Larry Reaves. (Fixes
   fd.o#18513.)
 * No longer asserts if you try to set the alias for someone not on your
   contact list. Empathy turns out to do this if you try to accept an
   authorization request. (Fixes fd.o#17382.)
 * Doesn't crash if you try to open a second connection to the same
   account. (Fixes fd.o#18361.)

telepathy-haze 0.2.1 (2008-08-18)
=================================

The “DUM DE DUM DE DIDDLE IDDLE DE DUM‼” release.

Dependencies:

 * Haze now requires telepathy-glib >= 0.7.0.

Fixes and Enhancements:

 * A publish channel now exists, which allows you to accept or decline
   incoming subscription requests (but nothing else yet; it's not
   possible to later remove someone from the list, for instance).
 * Add support for setting your avatar (fd.o #13123).
 * Stop your accounts auto-awaying themselves (fd.o #14335).
 * Don't crash when the UI passes an empty or otherwise invalid host
   name as the server parameter for a new connection (fd.o #14445).
 * Don't sporadically crash on connection errors, such as an incorrect
   password (fd.o #14933).
 * Debugging output from Haze and libpurple is now silenced unless you
   set HAZE_DEBUG appropriately ("haze" and "purple", respectively).

telepathy-haze 0.2.0 (2008-02-07)
=================================

The "I Remember Piano Lessons" release.

Fixes:

 * Protocols now present the correct parameters, with appropriate
   defaults, rather than always taking account, password and server.
 * Send apostrophes correctly on Yahoo! Messenger.

telepathy-haze 0.1.4 (2007-11-21)
=================================

The “Watch That Pinkie” release.

Fixes:

 * Fix building against glib 2.10 (which is the lowest version against
   which telepathy-glib builds).
 * Fix building against libpurple when built without D-Bus support, and
   suppress libpurple's own D-Bus messages on libpurple <= 2.1.0 (they
   were already suppressed on later libpurples).

telepathy-haze 0.1.3 (2007-11-14)
=================================

The “Fix the Sky a Little” release.

Fixes and Enhancements:

 * Don't mistakenly delete ~/.purple on exit with libpurple >= 2.3.0
 * Build without warnings against telepathy-glib 0.6.1.

 * Report message send errors.
 * Report reasons for disconnecting properly (requires libpurple >=
   2.3.0)

telepathy-haze 0.1.2 (2007-09-16)
=================================

The “Re: Your Brains” release.

Fixes:

 * Properly clean up zombie children.  No more mountains of defunct
   telepathy-haze processes!
 * Fix sending messages with <, > and &.  (Previously, "i <3 u" was sent
   as "i ", which is much less romantic.)
 * Use "local-xmpp" rather than "bonjour" as the name of the protocol
   formerly known as Rendezvous.

telepathy-haze 0.1.1 (2007-08-17)
=================================

The “Release less often, release correctly” release.

Fixes:

 * Fixed some segfaults, and some corruption caused by g_free-ing
   slice-allocated memory.

telepathy-haze 0.1.0 (2007-08-10)
=================================

The “It's Like The ... 90s” release.

Supported in this release:

 * Connecting to MSN, XMPP, AIM known to work.
 * Plain text conversations with individual contacts.
 * The 'subscribe' list, plus contact list groups.
 * Basic presence: available, busy, away, extended away, invisible, with
   a message when supported by the underlying prpl.
 * Retrieving your own server alias and those of your contacts, plus
   saving custom aliases for your contacts to the server (where
   supported by the prpl).
 * Retrieving your contacts' avatars (but not setting your own).
