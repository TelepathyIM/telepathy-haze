telepathy-haze 0.1.2 – "Re: Your Brains" (2007-09-16)
======================================================

 * Properly clean up zombie children.  No more mountains of defunct
   telepathy-haze processes!
 * Fix sending messages with <, > and &.  (Previously, "i <3 u" was sent as
   "i ", which is much less romantic.)
 * Use "local-xmpp" rather than "bonjour" as the name of the protocol
   formerly known as Rendezvous.

   slice-allocated memory.
